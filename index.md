[Ebenaĵaŝtormo is now available](https://archive.org/details/virabelo-ebenajastormo). I call it ebenaĵaŝtormo because the vibe reminds me of a storm brewing over a plain.

A new ambient drone called "Sovaĝinfano" is [now available](https://archive.org/details/virabelo-sovaginfano). I performed and recorded live in AUM on my iPad.

Today I performed and recorded a new ambient drone. I've been working on it for about a month now so it's nice to finally get it locked down into the digital forever. Originally I named it "mimas" as a tribute to a sunrizer preset that is used in the track. However, after I transferred the recording to my pc for post production, I accidentally titled it minas. After looking up online all the possible meanings of minas, I figured this name for the title will be just fine. 

Available on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/virabelo-minas), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/OWVFt4ZEdSE?si=UhosFYRSfFU6-iu7), [Bandcamp](https://virabelo.bandcamp.com/track/minas), and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/virabelo/minas).

Happy Drone Day folks! To celebrate Drone Day 2025, I made a video of a live performance of a track I made called "Oblation." I would have streamed the performance live, but I'm not eligible as I don't have at least 50 YouTube subscribers yet. Below is the link to the video...atm the webapp that I use to make YouTube thumbnails is down:

It's Drone Day Eve! I recorded a Drone Day Eve 2025 mix of Oblation, the track that I plan to perform tomorrow.

I put it up on [Internet Archivevc ](https://archive.org/details/oblation-drone-day-eve-2025-mix) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/virabelo/oblation-drone-day-eve-2025). 

Looking forward to performing it for YouTube tomorrow.

It's one week away from [Drone Day 2025](https://droneday.org). Here's a YouTube of my updated setup.

Today I'm experimenting with a track called Oblation which I plan to perform on Drone Day 2025. [I uploaded one of the practice sessions to SoundCloud](https://on.soundcloud.com/uhXDqutok3s11jf28). 

also put it up onto YouTube as well

Two more field recordings were made and uploaded today. The first one was recorded by the west fountain of Glen Lake, 

![Glen Lake](https://github.com/theambientdronesofvirabelo/Virabelo/blob/main/media/2025_05_13-12_27_37.jpg)

and the second one was recorded by the Virgin Mary statue at Our Lady Queen of Peace.

You can grab them @ [The Field Recordings of Virabelo Internet Archive Page](https://archive.org/details/thefieldrecordongsofvirabelo). 

They'll also be [available on freesound.org](https://freesound.org/people/virabelo/ ) once they have moderator approval. 

✵

Since my freesound.org field recording submissions are still waiting for moderation approval, I figured I'd make an [archive.org account](https://archive.org/details/@virabelo) and have [a page where I'll upload field recordings that I make](https://archive.org/details/thefieldrecordongsofvirabelo). 

✵

I started a Virabelo YouTube channel. Here's an introductory video where I share the setup that I plan to use on [Drone Day 2025](https://droneday.org).

Here's a [field recording](https://freesound.org/people/virabelo/sounds/804969/) that I made in April of 2023 when I went to go pickup lunch at the New Bamboo Garden. They have a wonderful Singapore Mei Fun there too.

[I made an account](https://freesound.org/people/virabelo/) on [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) where I plan to upload field recordings that I create.

[Here's my first upload](https://freesound.org/people/virabelo/sounds/804964/). I made it two Augusts ago when we were waiting for a table outside of Clancy's By The Sea on the boardwalk of Ocean City, New Jersey.

Welcome to my undated journal. This markdown file is pretty much the 'meat & potatoes' of the repository.

I'm very excited to be back in my Virabelo project. It's been over a decade since I've done anything with it. 

The releases back then were more in the ambient/minimal/techno vein. This time around I think, that for the most part, I'll be concentrating on creating ambient drones. 

I recently downloaded Mononoke and am learning how to have fun with it.
