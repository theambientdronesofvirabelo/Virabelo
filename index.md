Welcome to my undated journal. This markdown file is pretty much the 'meat & potatoes' of the repository.

I'm very excited to be back in my Virabelo project. It's been over a decade since I've done anything with it. 

The releases back then were more in the ambient/minimal/techno vein. This time around I think, that for the most part, I'll be concentrating on creating ambient drones. 

I recently downloaded Mononoke, and am learning how to have fun with it.
