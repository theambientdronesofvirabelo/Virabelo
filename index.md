## The Journal of Virabelo 

~

**may/08/2025**
Welcome to my journal. This markdown file is pretty much the 'meat & potatoes' of the website.

I'm very excited to be back in my Virabelo project. It's been over a decade since I've done anything with it. 

My first Virabelo releases back then were more in the ambient/drone techno vein. This time around I think, that for the most part, I'll be concentrating on ambient drones. 

I recently downloaded Mononoke, am am learning how to have fun with it.
