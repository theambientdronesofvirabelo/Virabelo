# The Undated Journal of Virabelo 

Since my freesound.org field recording submissions are still waiting moderation approval, I figured I'd make an archive.org account and have [a page where I'll post past and future field recordings](https://archive.org/details/thefieldrecordongsofvirabelo). 

✵

I started a Virabelo YouTube channel. Here's an introductory video where I share the setup that I plan to use on [Drone Day 2025](https://droneday.org).

Here's a [field recording](https://freesound.org/people/virabelo/sounds/804969/) that I made in April of 2023 when I went to go pickup lunch at the New Bamboo Garden. They have a wonderful Singapore Mei Fun there too.

[I made an account](https://freesound.org/people/virabelo/) on [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) where I plan to upload field recordings that I create. I plan for them to be licensed under [Creative Commons BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) so feel free to use what you like while giving Virabelo a line in your credits section. 

[Here's my first upload](https://freesound.org/people/virabelo/sounds/804964/). I made it two Augusts ago when we were waiting for a table outside of Clancy's By The Sea on the boardwalk of Ocean City, New Jersey.

Welcome to my undated journal. This markdown file is pretty much the 'meat & potatoes' of the repository.

I'm very excited to be back in my Virabelo project. It's been over a decade since I've done anything with it. 

The releases back then were more in the ambient/minimal/techno vein. This time around I think, that for the most part, I'll be concentrating on creating ambient drones. 

I recently downloaded Mononoke, and am learning how to have fun with it.
